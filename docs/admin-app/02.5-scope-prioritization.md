# Phase 2.5 — Scope Prioritization (Demo Core Reduction)

## Prioritization model

Criteria used:
- Investor impact
- Visual clarity
- Technical risk
- Refactor complexity
- Dependency depth
- Backend support maturity

Legend:
- Complexity: Low / Medium / High
- Risk: Low / Medium / High

---

## Tier A — Demo Core (must-have before investor demo)

## A1. POS shell with clear hierarchy and primary workspace
- Why: instantly changes perception from test UI to product UI; highest visible impact.
- Complexity: **Medium**
- Risk: **Medium** (layout regressions)
- Dependencies: `App.svelte`, existing routes, token styles.

## A2. Unified guest context (identify/select guest quickly)
- Why: every money operation depends on correct guest context; reduces operator errors.
- Complexity: **Medium**
- Risk: **Medium**
- Dependencies: `guestStore`, `Guests.svelte`, guest list/detail components.

## A3. Top-up flow upgrade (presets + keypad + robust states)
- Why: top-up is core revenue operation and strongest demo moment.
- Complexity: **Medium**
- Risk: **Medium**
- Dependencies: `TopUpModal` (or replacement panel), `guestStore.topUpBalance`, `uiStore`.

## A4. Balance + recent history in one focused screen block
- Why: demonstrates trust and operational transparency.
- Complexity: **Low-Medium**
- Risk: **Low-Medium**
- Dependencies: existing guest detail + available transaction/pour data; graceful fallback if transaction API absent.

## A5. Shift visibility + basic open/close UX (demo-safe)
- Why: enterprise maturity signal; required in narrative for operations.
- Complexity: **Medium**
- Risk: **High** if coupled to missing backend endpoints.
- Dependencies: `systemStore` + local UI state; must allow stub mode if no shift API.

## A6. Error UX baseline (next-best-action messages)
- Why: prevents demo dead-ends; high confidence during presentation.
- Complexity: **Low-Medium**
- Risk: **Low**
- Dependencies: `uiStore`, toast/confirm components, per-flow error mapping.

## Tier B — Demo Enhancers (only if safe & fast)

## B1. Inline undo after top-up (timer)
- Why: impressive “mature POS” cue.
- Complexity: **Medium**
- Risk: **Medium-High** (depends on backend undo support).
- Dependencies: reversible transaction endpoint or incident fallback.

## B2. Card block/reissue polished flow
- Why: strong enterprise feature, but less frequent in demo.
- Complexity: **Medium-High**
- Risk: **High** (edge cases: card conflicts, partial state).
- Dependencies: card lifecycle API maturity; NFC reliability.

## B3. Unsynced queue indicator
- Why: improves credibility for degraded mode.
- Complexity: **Medium**
- Risk: **Medium**
- Dependencies: actual sync queue data or mock-only indicator.

## B4. Incident center page (structured)
- Why: good ops narrative, but not required for base demo.
- Complexity: **Medium**
- Risk: **Medium**
- Dependencies: backend incident endpoint; otherwise local stub.

## B5. Investor metrics panel refinement
- Why: visually appealing, but secondary to cashier flows.
- Complexity: **Low-Medium**
- Risk: **Low-Medium**
- Dependencies: existing panel + data mapping.

---

## Tier C — Production Backlog (explicitly deferred)

## C1. Full offline-first queue with replay/conflict resolution
- Why defer: high architecture cost and broad regression surface.
- Complexity: **High**
- Risk: **High**
- Dependencies: backend contracts + durable local queue.

## C2. Full RBAC and audit permissions model in UI
- Why defer: needs coordinated backend auth model and policy decisions.
- Complexity: **High**
- Risk: **High**
- Dependencies: backend roles/claims endpoints and policy matrix.

## C3. Advanced analytics/report builder
- Why defer: low impact on core cashier demo flow.
- Complexity: **High**
- Risk: **Medium**
- Dependencies: reporting backend, filters, exports.

## C4. Multi-device sync diagnostics console
- Why defer: engineering-heavy and low demo necessity.
- Complexity: **High**
- Risk: **Medium-High**
- Dependencies: controller telemetry APIs.

## C5. Deep incident workflow automation/SLA tracking
- Why defer: process-heavy and not demo-critical.
- Complexity: **Medium-High**
- Risk: **Medium**
- Dependencies: incident service + notifications.

## Frozen demo scope proposal

### Final Tier A (scope lock)
1. Shell + operational status visibility (simplified)
2. Guest context flow (identify/select)
3. Top-up upgraded UX
4. Balance + recent history block
5. Shift open/close lightweight workflow (with safe stubs)
6. Error handling with next best action

### Tier B implementation gate
Implement only if:
- build is stable,
- no contract changes required,
- delivery < 0.5–1 dev day per enhancer,
- no increased regression risk to Tier A.
